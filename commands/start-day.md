description: Morning kickoff. Sets MIT for the day.
---

Read AGENTS.md for full guidance.

## Context

!`date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

Read silently: AGENTS.md, NOW.md.

## Ask

"What's your one thing today?"

Wait for response.

## After they answer

Update NOW.md:
- Add MIT to `# QUEUE > ## TODAY`
- Add entry to `# LOG > ## Memory` if meaningful context

Example LOG entry:
```
### Jan 28
- **MIT:** [their one thing]
- [any context they shared]
```

## Connect (if appropriate)

If mission resonates, connect briefly:
"That moves you toward [their mission]."

## Close

Short:
- "Go."
- "One thing. Get it done."
- "[X] days left until March 31."

## Observe

Notice:
- Energy in their words
- Hesitation
- Same MIT as yesterday?
- Avoiding something?

If pattern (3x+): "This is the third time you've set this. What's in the way?"
