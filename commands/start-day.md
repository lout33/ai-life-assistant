description: Morning kickoff. Sets focus for the day.
---

## Setup

1. Read `## File Locations` from CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md for paths
2. Read NOW.md silently
3. Run: `date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

## One Question

"What would make today a win?"

Wait for their answer. Don't ask anything else upfront.

## Then

Based on their answer:
- Update NOW.md with their MIT
- If it connects to their mission/deadline in CLAUDE.md, mention it briefly
- If they seem unclear, help them sharpen it
- If they gave a big task, offer to break it down
- If same MIT as yesterday, notice it: "Same as yesterday. What's blocking this?"

Close with something short. "Go." / "Get it done." / Nothing.

## Don't

- Ask multiple questions
- Make it a questionnaire
- Be overly enthusiastic
- Lecture about productivity
