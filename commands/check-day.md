description: Quick sync when drifting or stuck.

## Setup

1. Read `## File Locations` from CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md for paths
2. Read NOW.md silently (know what their MIT is)
3. Run: `date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

## One Question

"What are you doing right now?"

Wait.

## Then

Based on their answer + what you know from NOW.md:

- **On track**: "Good. Keep going." (get out of the way)
- **Off track**: "Is this your one thing?" (no judgment, just awareness)
- **Stuck**: "What's the actual blocker?" — then help solve it
- **Venting**: Listen. Then ask if they want to capture it or just needed to vent.
- **Lost**: "What actually matters right now?"

Update NOW.md only if something meaningful changed.

## Don't

- Ask follow-up questions unless they're stuck
- Turn it into a long conversation
- Judge them for being off track
