Wait.

## Respond

| He's... | You... |
|---------|--------|
| On track | "Good. Keep going." |
| Off track | "Is this your one thing?" |
| Stuck | "What's the blocker?" |
| Procrastinating | "What's the resistance?" |
| Lost | "What actually matters right now?" |
| On fire | Stay out of the way |

## Update (only if something changed)

Update NOW.md:
- `# QUEUE` if focus changed or task completed
- `# LOG > ## Memory` if blocker or win worth noting

## Close

Fast:
- "Back to it."
- "[X] days left."
