description: Evening review. Captures wins, lessons.
---

Read AGENTS.md for full guidance.

## Context

!`date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

Read silently: AGENTS.md, NOW.md.

## Ask

"How'd it go?"

Let them talk.

## Follow up (one question max)

- "Did you get your one thing done?"
- "What got in the way?"
- "Anything carrying to tomorrow?"

Or nothing.

## Update NOW.md

Update `# LOG > ## Memory` with day summary:
```
### Jan 28
- **MIT result:** [done/not done + brief why]
- [key wins, lessons, or observations]
```

Update `# QUEUE`:
- Mark completed tasks with [x]
- Move unfinished items to tomorrow if needed

Update `## Content Shipped` table if content was shipped today.

## Observe

If hit MIT multiple days: "That's [N] days in a row. What's working?"

If missed MIT: "What got in the way?" - no guilt

## Close

Short:
- "Rest."
- "Tomorrow: [their next thing if set]"
