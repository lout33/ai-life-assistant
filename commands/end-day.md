description: Evening review. Captures what happened.
---

## Setup

1. Read `## File Locations` from CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md for paths
2. Read NOW.md silently (know what their MIT was)
3. Run: `date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

## One Question

"What happened today?"

Let them talk. Listen.

## Then

Based on their response:
- Acknowledge wins if they had them
- If they missed MIT, ask "What got in the way?" — no guilt, just curiosity
- If pattern emerging (3+ times), name it: "That's the third time you mentioned X."
- If something should carry to tomorrow, capture it

Update NOW.md:
- Add Memory Log entry with date and key observation
- Quote their words if something important was said
- Update MIT for tomorrow if they mentioned it

## Don't

- Ask 5 follow-up questions
- Force them to reflect if they just want to close out
- Be preachy about what they should have done
- Make it heavy — some days are just days

## Close

Short: "Rest." / "Tomorrow: [their next thing]" / Nothing.
