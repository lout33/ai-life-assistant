## What to Notice

- **USER.md** has psychological "bugs" -- patterns the agent catches over time
- **NOW.md > LOG** shows the agent's memory building session by session
- **AGENTS.md** has protocols specific to each person's avoidance patterns
- **SOUL.md** personality is tuned to what each person needs (pushy for procrastinators, supportive for the overwhelmed)
