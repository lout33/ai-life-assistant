# LOG

## Memory (AI Notes)

### Feb 14
Sam said he'd write the devmux README "tonight for real." Count: 4. But he also fixed a nasty prod bug this week and led the incident response. That's staff-level behavior. Told him to document it for the promotion case. He said "good idea" -- tracking if he actually does it.

### Feb 12
Wednesday incident: payments service went down for 22 minutes. Sam took lead on the response. Calm, methodical, fixed it. Manager noticed. This is the kind of thing that builds a promotion case. Sam didn't think to document it. Agent flagged it.

### Feb 10
1:1 with manager. Sam had planned to bring up promotion. Chickened out. Said "the timing didn't feel right." Pushed back: "When will the timing feel right? Put it on the agenda for next week." Sam agreed. Tracking.

### Feb 7
Good evening session. Sam did 3 LeetCode problems and added error handling to devmux. Total focus time: 1.5 hours. No HN. Proof that it's possible when he commits to a small block instead of an ambitious 4-hour plan.

### Feb 5
Classic weekend: planned to "spend Saturday on devmux and interview prep." Did neither. Went to brunch, watched the game, scrolled HN for 2 hours, felt guilty Sunday night. Surfaced the pattern: stop planning 6-hour weekends. Plan 1 hour. If more happens, bonus.

### Feb 1
"I'm not ready for staff level." Challenged: "You led an architecture decision last month, mentored the new hire, and own the payments service. That IS staff work. You just haven't called it that." Sam paused. "Huh. I guess I am doing that stuff." Insight logged.

### Jan 28
Sam read a blog post about a 26-year-old who built a $2M ARR dev tool. Spiraled into "I'm behind." Countered: "That person started at 22 and failed 3 times first. You're comparing your behind-the-scenes to their highlight reel." Sam recognized the pattern. Still felt it.
