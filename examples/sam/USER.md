# USER.md - Sam's Profile

## Identity
- **Name:** Sam | **Age:** 30 | **Location:** Denver, CO (GMT-7)
- **Role:** Mid-level Backend Engineer at a Series B startup (150 people)
- **GitHub:** samcodes_ | **YOE:** 6

## Who I Am

30-year-old backend developer. 6 years of experience, mostly Python and Go. Works at a Series B startup that's fine but not exciting. Good pay, decent team, but the technical challenges peaked 2 years ago. Now it's mostly maintenance, feature flags, and sprint ceremonies.

Lives with girlfriend and a dog. Runs 3x/week. Reads too many tech blogs. Has a side project (a developer tool) that's been "almost ready" for 8 months.

The pattern: gets home, eats dinner, opens laptop with good intentions, browses HN for 2 hours, closes laptop, feels guilty. Repeat.

Wants to either get promoted to senior/staff or leave for a bigger company. Has been "thinking about it" for over a year without making a move.

## Mission
> "Stop coasting and actually build the career I want."

**This year's goal:** Either get promoted to Senior at current company OR land a Senior/Staff role at a top-tier company. Ship the side project publicly.

**The honest version:** Sam knows he's comfortable. The job pays well enough. Nothing is urgent. But he's 30 now and can feel the window for big career moves getting smaller. The comfort is the trap.

## Stack
Python | Go | PostgreSQL | Redis | AWS | Docker/K8s | Some React (enough to be dangerous)

## Career

| When | Where | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| 2024-now | Stackflow (Series B) | Mid-level Backend |
| 2021-2024 | DataPipe (acquired) | Backend Engineer |
| 2019-2021 | Agency work | Full Stack (various clients) |

## Schedule

**Weekdays:**
- 8:30am - Start work (remote, home office)
- 9:00am - Standup
- 9:30am-12:30pm - Focus block (best coding hours)
- 12:30pm - Lunch + walk the dog
- 1:30pm-5:30pm - Meetings, code reviews, slack
- 6:00pm - Gym or run
- 7:30pm - Dinner
- 8:30pm-10:30pm - "Side project time" (usually HN + YouTube)
- 11:00pm - Bed

**Weekends:**
- Saturday: errands, social, "I'll code in the afternoon" (50% success rate)
- Sunday: meal prep, anxiety about Monday, sometimes productive after 4pm

## Core Wiring

| Works | Doesn't Work |
|-------|--------------|
| Debugging hard problems | Sprint planning meetings |
| Learning through building | Reading docs without a project |
| Pair programming with strong engineers | Working alone on boring features |
| Clear deadlines (on-call, incidents) | Vague "when you get to it" tasks |
| Side project when genuinely interested | Side project out of obligation/guilt |

## Energy Map

| Charges | Drains |
|---------|--------|
| Solving a gnarly production bug | Adding feature flags for A/B tests |
| Architecture discussions | Sprint retrospectives |
| Side project breakthroughs | Side project guilt |
| Running | Sitting in back-to-back meetings |
| Reading a great technical post | Doom-scrolling HN for 2 hours |
| Helping a junior dev level up | Writing Jira tickets |

## Psychology

**Drivers:** Wants to be genuinely good, not just employed. Fears being "just another mid-level dev" at 35.

**Bugs (discovered over 3 months of sessions):**
1. **HN as procrastination:** Averages 1.5 hours/day reading HN, tech Twitter, blog posts. Feels productive because it's "learning." It's not. It's avoidance with a tech flavor.
2. **"Almost ready" syndrome:** The side project has been "almost ready" for 8 months. Always one more feature, one more refactor. The real blocker is fear of putting it out and getting 0 stars.
3. **Comfort coasting:** Job is fine. Pay is fine. Nothing is on fire. This is the most dangerous state because there's no forcing function to grow. "Fine" is the enemy of "great."
4. **Interview avoidance:** Says he wants to work at a bigger company but hasn't done a single LeetCode problem or system design practice. "I'll start prepping next month" has been said 5 times.
5. **Comparison spiral:** Reads about 25-year-olds becoming staff engineers at FAANG and feels behind. Ignores that his 6 years of real production experience is valuable. The comparison drains energy without producing action.
6. **Weekend planning fallacy:** Plans ambitious coding weekends. Delivers maybe 30% of the plan. Then feels worse than if he'd planned nothing. The gap between plan and execution creates guilt that kills the next weekend too.
7. **Promotion passivity:** Wants a promotion but hasn't explicitly asked for one or created a case for it. Expects the manager to notice. Managers are busy. They don't notice.

**What works:** Committing to 30 minutes instead of 3 hours (actually happens) | Accountability: telling someone "I'll ship this by Friday" | Incident response mode (clear problem, tight deadline, adrenaline) | Morning focus block before meetings kill the day

**What doesn't work:** Ambitious evening plans after a full work day | "I'll do LeetCode for 2 hours" blocks | Motivation from reading success stories (sugar high, crashes fast)

## Side Project: devmux

A terminal multiplexer for dev environments. Sets up your entire project (db, server, watchers, tests) with one command. Like docker-compose but for local dev.

- **Status:** Works locally. No README. Private repo. "One more feature" away from public for 8 months.
- **Actual blocker:** Fear that nobody will care. The code works. The marketing is scary.
- **What needs to happen:** Write a README, make the repo public, post on r/programming. That's it. 2 hours of work.

## What Sam Actually Wants

Build tools that developers use. Get recognized as someone who builds things, not just someone who works a job. Eventually: either staff engineer at a company he respects, or independent (consulting + open source).

The real fear: that he's average. That the side project will prove it. Easier to keep it private and imagine it could be great than to ship it and find out.
