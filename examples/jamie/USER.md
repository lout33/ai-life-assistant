# USER.md - Jamie's Profile

## Identity
- **Name:** Jamie | **Age:** 22 | **Location:** Austin, TX (GMT-6)
- **Type:** CS Junior at UT Austin
- **GitHub:** jamiebuilds

## Who I Am

22-year-old CS student, junior year. Lives in a shared apartment near campus. Has a cat named Byte. Runs in the morning when motivated (3x/week on a good week, 0 on a bad one).

Does freelance web dev on the side (2-3 clients at a time, mostly small business sites). Wants to build a real product but keeps getting pulled back to client work because it pays rent.

Good at learning fast, bad at finishing things. Has 14 private repos of unfinished side projects. Starts strong, loses interest when the hard part begins (deployment, testing, polish).

Wants a summer internship at a good company but has applied to exactly 2 places despite bookmarking 40+.

## Mission
> "Graduate, get a great internship, and eventually build something of my own."

**This semester:** Pass all classes (3.4+ GPA), land a summer internship, ship ONE side project publicly.

**The real desire:** Wants to be a founder eventually. But knows he needs experience first and tends to use "I'll start a company someday" as an excuse to not apply to internships now.

## Stack
TypeScript/React | Python | Some Rust (learning) | PostgreSQL | Vercel/Railway

## Core Wiring

| Works | Doesn't Work |
|-------|--------------|
| Building new things from scratch | Studying for exams (boring) |
| Tight deadlines (crams well) | Long-term projects without deadlines |
| Learning by building | Learning by reading textbooks |
| Working alongside someone | Working alone for long stretches |
| Late night coding sessions | Morning productivity (lies to himself about this) |

## Energy Map

| Charges | Drains |
|---------|--------|
| Shipping something, even small | Studying material he doesn't care about |
| Helping classmates debug code | Freelance client revision requests |
| Learning a new framework | Reviewing old lecture notes |
| Side project breakthroughs | Job application forms |
| Running (when he actually goes) | Thinking about running but not going |

## Psychology

**Drivers:** Wants to prove he can build real things, not just pass classes

**Bugs (discovered over 2 months of sessions):**
1. **YouTube black hole:** "One video" becomes 3 hours. Every time. Usually triggered by finishing something hard (reward-seeking) or facing something boring (avoidance).
2. **Application paralysis:** Has 40+ bookmarked internships, applied to 2. The blocker isn't the resume -- it's fear of rejection. Easier to bookmark than to submit.
3. **Notion theater:** Spends Sunday afternoons building elaborate study systems instead of studying. The system IS the procrastination.
4. **"I'll do it tomorrow" loop:** Said this about the OS project 4 times before cramming it the night before. Pattern: delay -> panic -> cram -> survive -> repeat. Works for grades, doesn't work for learning.
5. **Freelance guilt:** Takes client work because it pays, then feels guilty about not working on his own project. Neither gets full attention.
6. **Private repo graveyard:** 14 unfinished projects. Starts with excitement, abandons at the deployment/polish stage. The fun part (building) is done, so motivation dies.
7. **Compares to CS Twitter:** Sees people his age shipping products with 10K users and feels behind. Doesn't see their 3 years of failed attempts before that.

**What works:** Study with a friend (accountability) | Deadlines within 48 hours (urgency) | Building something to learn a concept (not reading about it) | The agent tracking his "I'll do it tomorrow" count

**What doesn't work:** "Study from 2-6pm" blocks (never happens) | Pomodoro (breaks become permanent) | Motivation videos (feels good, produces nothing)

## What Jamie Actually Wants

If he's honest: build a developer tool, get users, and eventually not need a 9-5. But that's "someday." Right now: survive the semester, land an internship, and stop feeling behind.

The side project (a CLI tool for managing dev environments) is the thing he actually cares about. Everything else is obligation.
