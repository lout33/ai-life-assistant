# LOG

## Memory (AI Notes)

### Feb 14
Jamie said he'd apply to Linear "tonight." This is the 4th time. Tracking.

### Feb 12
Finished algorithms problem set 2 days early. First time this semester. Suggested a break. Jamie immediately opened his side project instead. Not a real break.

### Feb 10
3-hour YouTube session after finishing a freelance deliverable. Pattern: finish something -> reward with "one video" -> 3 hours disappear. Surfaced the pattern. Jamie acknowledged it but said "I know, I know."

### Feb 7
Good session. Jamie applied to GitHub internship (2nd application total). Was nervous about the resume. We rewrote the project descriptions together in 10 minutes. He said "that was way less painful than I expected." Quote saved.

### Feb 5
Jamie spent all of Sunday "planning his week" in Notion. Built a new dashboard. Didn't study. The planning IS the procrastination. Called it out. Jamie laughed and said "you're right." Then kept building the dashboard.

### Feb 2
"I'll start the OS assignment tomorrow." Count: 3. Started it at 11pm the night before it was due. Got a B-. Could have been an A with one more day.

### Jan 28
Side project had a breakthrough: config parser working. Jamie was genuinely excited. Best energy I've seen. This is what he actually wants to work on.
