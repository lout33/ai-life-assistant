# LOG

## Memory (AI Notes)

### Feb 14
Morgan used ChatGPT for the product launch email subject lines. Generated 15 options in 3 minutes, picked 5, tested 2. Said "okay, THAT was useful." This is the breakthrough moment -- using AI on a real task during work hours, not as evening homework. The workflow is sticking.

### Feb 12
Morgan tried Claude for meeting notes. Copy-pasted raw notes, got a mediocre summary. Was about to give up. Walked through prompt improvement: added context about what decisions were made vs just discussed, who owns what. Second attempt was much better. Lesson: the first try is never the real result.

### Feb 10
Monday morning. Morgan opened 3 AI newsletters and spent 40 minutes reading. Felt anxious. Didn't apply anything. Challenged: "One thing from those newsletters you can use TODAY. Go." She picked a prompt structure for competitive analysis. We built it together in 15 minutes. That 15 minutes was worth more than the 40 minutes of reading.

### Feb 7
Morgan mentioned signing up for a new AI copywriting tool. Asked: "Are you using Jasper? Copy.ai? Notion AI?" Answer: "Not really." Redirected: use ChatGPT (which she already pays for) and get good at prompts before adding tools. She agreed. Saved her $30/month and another unused subscription.

### Feb 5
Tried to do AI exploration at 9pm. Too tired. Watched Netflix instead, felt guilty. Surfaced the pattern: evening plans for AI learning always fail. Moved it to 8:30am Wednesday, blocked on calendar. "If it's not on the calendar before meetings start, it won't happen."

### Feb 1
First real win: used ChatGPT to brainstorm 20 content ideas for Q1. Said it normally takes her an hour with the team. Did it in 15 minutes solo, then brought the best 8 to the team meeting. Team was impressed. "Where'd all these ideas come from?" She said "I used AI." First time saying that at work. Visibility moment.

### Jan 28
Morgan: "I feel like I'm falling behind on AI." Reality check: she's further ahead than 80% of marketing managers. She has working workflows. Most people are still just reading about it. The feeling of being behind is created by newsletters, not reality.
