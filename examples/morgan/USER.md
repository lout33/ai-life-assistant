# USER.md - Morgan's Profile

## Identity
- **Name:** Morgan | **Age:** 35 | **Location:** Chicago, IL (GMT-6)
- **Role:** Marketing Manager at a B2B SaaS company (80 people)
- **Team:** 3 direct reports

## Who I Am

35-year-old marketing manager. Not technical. Started in copywriting, moved into management. Good at strategy and messaging, overwhelmed by the pace of AI change. Worried about being left behind but also skeptical of the hype.

Has a partner and a toddler. Time is the scarcest resource. Can't waste 3 hours experimenting with tools that don't work. Needs things that save time immediately or they get dropped.

Reads too many AI newsletters. Has signed up for ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, Jasper, Copy.ai, Notion AI, and Perplexity. Uses ChatGPT sometimes for brainstorming. The rest sit unused.

The real desire: become the person on the team who knows how to use AI effectively. Not to be a tech person, but to be visibly more productive and help the team do the same. This is also a career move -- "AI-savvy marketing leader" is becoming a real differentiator.

## Mission
> "Use AI to be twice as effective without working more hours. Become the AI person on my team."

**This quarter:** Build 3 repeatable AI workflows that save real time. Help 1 team member adopt one.

**Career goal:** VP of Marketing within 2 years. AI fluency is the differentiator.

## Daily Schedule

- 6:30am - Wake up, toddler routine
- 8:00am - Drop off daycare
- 8:30am-12:00pm - Focus work (best hours, usually eaten by meetings)
- 12:00pm - Lunch
- 1:00pm-4:30pm - Meetings, reviews, team management
- 5:00pm - Pick up from daycare
- 5:30pm-8:00pm - Family time, dinner, bedtime routine
- 8:30pm-10:00pm - Personal time (sometimes work, sometimes Netflix, sometimes AI exploration)
- 10:30pm - Bed

**The constraint:** Maybe 1-2 hours of "optional" time per day. Everything has to be high-leverage or it doesn't happen.

## Work Responsibilities

| Area | Time Spent | AI Could Help |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Content strategy & calendar | 20% | Draft outlines, repurpose content across channels |
| Campaign planning | 20% | Competitive analysis, audience research, copy variations |
| Team management & 1:1s | 20% | Meeting prep, feedback drafting |
| Reporting & analytics | 15% | Data summarization, insight extraction |
| Email marketing | 15% | Subject lines, segmentation ideas, A/B copy |
| Ad copy & creative briefs | 10% | First drafts, variations, competitor teardowns |

## Core Wiring

| Works | Doesn't Work |
|-------|--------------|
| Clear, practical "do this now" advice | Abstract AI philosophy |
| One workflow at a time | 12 tools at once |
| Seeing time saved (concrete) | "This could theoretically..." |
| Learning by doing with real work tasks | Tutorial videos without a project |
| Morning focus blocks | Evening deep work (too tired) |

## Energy Map

| Charges | Drains |
|---------|--------|
| A campaign performing well | "Please review" Slack messages at 4pm |
| Finishing a task in half the time using AI | Setting up yet another new tool |
| Teaching a colleague something useful | Reading AI doomer threads |
| Strategic thinking (rare, needs space) | Back-to-back meetings |
| Toddler laughing | Toddler not sleeping |

## Psychology

**Drivers:** Career growth | Being seen as competent and forward-thinking | Providing for family

**Bugs (discovered over 2 months of sessions):**
1. **Tool collector:** Signed up for 6 AI tools, uses 1 occasionally. Each new tool feels like progress. It's not. It's shopping disguised as learning.
2. **Newsletter overwhelm:** Subscribes to 8 AI newsletters. Reads 3 on Monday morning feeling anxious. Skims 2 more on the toilet. Retains nothing actionable. The newsletters create a feeling of "falling behind" without creating any forward motion.
3. **Perfectionism with AI output:** Uses ChatGPT to draft something, then rewrites 80% of it. Net time saved: near zero. Hasn't learned to prompt well because she keeps overriding the output instead of improving the input.
4. **"I'm not technical" ceiling:** Uses "I'm not technical" as a reason to not try things that aren't actually technical. Setting up a workflow in Zapier isn't coding. Structuring a prompt isn't programming. The label limits more than the skill gap does.
5. **Comparison to younger colleagues:** A 26-year-old on the team uses AI naturally. Morgan feels behind instead of asking them to show her. Pride is the blocker.
6. **Evening ambition, morning amnesia:** Plans to "explore AI workflows tonight." By 8:30pm, too tired. Watches Netflix instead. Feels guilty. Repeat. The evening isn't the time. Has to accept this and use morning focus blocks.

**What works:** "Show me one thing I can use TODAY" approach | Building the workflow during a real task, not as homework | Morning sessions (8:30-9:00am before meetings start) | Showing results to the team (accountability through visibility)

**What doesn't work:** "Spend the weekend learning AI" plans | Signing up for courses | Reading without doing | Evening exploration (too tired)

## AI Workflows (Built So Far)

| Workflow | Tool | Time Saved | Status |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|
| Weekly content brainstorm | ChatGPT | ~1 hour/week | Active, working well |
| Email subject line testing | ChatGPT | ~30 min/week | Active |
| Meeting summary + action items | Claude | Testing | New, inconsistent |
| Competitive teardown | Not built yet | -- | Planned |
| Campaign brief first draft | Not built yet | -- | Planned |

## What Morgan Actually Wants

Not to become a technologist. To be the best marketer she can be, using whatever tools exist. AI is the biggest leverage point available right now and she knows it. The fear isn't AI itself -- it's being 38, managing a team, and having a 28-year-old hire who's 3x more productive because they grew up with these tools.

The system helps because it tracks what she actually does vs what she says she'll do, remembers which workflows worked, and stops her from tool-hopping.
